# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the Titanic EDA project! This repository contains a detailed exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset using **Google Colab**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights through statistical and visual exploration of the data.

---

## 📁 Project Files

- (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Avc0pa8auTTWG1dqk_pnuNfHaS_01LCN): Main Colab notebook containing code, visualizations, and observations.
- `titanic.csv`: The dataset used for analysis (assumed to be uploaded in the Colab notebook or accessed via a link).
- `README.md`: This file – documenting the project overview.

## 🎯 Objective

To explore the Titanic dataset and extract insights about the passengers' survival patterns using:
- Descriptive statistics
- Visual exploration (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, etc.)
- Statistical relationships among variables

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Survival Rate**: ~38% of passengers survived.
- **Gender Impact**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Class Factor**: First-class passengers had better chances of survival than second- and third-class.
- **Age Patterns**: Children were more likely to survive; median age of survivors was lower.
- **Fare Influence**: Higher fare-paying passengers had a higher chance of survival.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3** (via Google Colab)
- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for visualization
- `numpy` – for numerical operations

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   [![Open In Colab]([https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/your-repo-name/blob/main/Titanic_EDA_Colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Avc0pa8auTTWG1dqk_pnuNfHaS_01LCN))

2. Upload the `titanic.csv` dataset or load it from a source like Kaggle.

3. Run each cell sequentially to:
   - Explore the dataset structure using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
   - Visualize data using countplots, boxplots, heatmaps, violin plots, etc.
   - Interpret insights through markdown summaries after each plot

---

## 📌 Sample Visualizations

- 📦 **Boxplot**: Age distribution by survival
- 🔥 **Heatmap**: Correlation between numeric features
- 🎻 **Violin Plot**: Age distribution by class and survival
- 📊 **Histogram**: Fare and Age distributions
- 🟦 **Countplot**: Survival counts with annotated values

---

## 📌 Summary

This analysis highlights how **gender**, **class**, **fare**, and **age** influenced survival during the Titanic disaster. Visual tools helped in uncovering patterns and outliers in the data, while descriptive statistics helped support these insights quantitatively.
